### Objectives

    my-ls consists on creating your own ls command.

    The ls command shows you the files and folders of the directory specified after the command. By exclusion of this directory, it shows the files and folders of the present directory.

    The behavior of your ls must be identical to the original ls command with the following variations :
        You must incorporate in your project at least the following flags of the ls command :
            -l
            -R
            -a
            -r
            -t
        Note that you can use various flags, in various ways, just like in ls.
        When it comes to the ls -l display, it must be identical to the system command.
        Other flags displays are up to you.

    Your project must be written in Go.
    The code must respect the good practices.
    It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.
